2) How to change colors from Red to Blue in WooShop.

First you need to download blue WooShop styles from this link:

http://dessky.com/wp-content/uploads/wooshop_blue.zip

After you have unpacked the styles you will see folder 'wooshop_blue' and there you will find 'assets' folder.
Then you need to copy entire 'assets' folder into the wooshop theme's directory (/wp-content/themes/wooshop) overwriting everything there. 
After that refresh your website in your browser and you will find that your WooShop theme is now blue :)

Enjoy!
